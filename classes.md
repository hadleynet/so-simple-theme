## Karate Kids

Karate Kids, offered at 9:00am on Saturdays, is a program designed for
children aged 5-10 using games and developmentally appropriate
activities to promote fitness, introduce basic karate techniques and
encourage character building.

Each class begins with a warm-up segment where children are given an
opportunity to lead the class if they wish. The students are then
assigned to small groups to work with an instructor who introduces and
reinforces basic karate techniques using materials and equipment that
make learning fun. Games such as Simon Says, Red Light/Green Light, and
the Noodle Game are utilized to further reinforce techniques.

Students who begin in the Karate Kids program are slowly transitioned
into the regular beginner class based on their readiness.
