The Hollis Karate Club was established in Hollis, NH, in 1987. The club
moved to Brookline, NH, and assumed its new name: the Souhegan Valley
Karate Club. Despite the change of names, SVKC has always been a source
of knowledge, training, and exercise for entire families interested in
the martial arts.

We welcome visitors any Saturday morning between 9:00 and 11:00am.
